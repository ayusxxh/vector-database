How can we prepare ourselves and our children for a world of such \\nunprecedented transformations and radical uncertainties? A baby born today will be thirty -something in \\n2050. If all goes well, that baby will sti ll be around in 2100, and might even be an active citizen of the 22nd \\ncentury. What should we teach that baby that will help him or her survive and flourish in the world of 2050 \\nor of the 22nd century? What kind of skills will he or she need in order to ge t a job, understand what is \\nhappening around them and navigate the maze of life?  \\nUnfortunately, since nobody knows how the world will look in 2050 – not to mention 2100 – we don’t \\nknow the answer to these questions. Of course, humans have never been able t o predict the future with \\naccuracy. But today it is more difficult than ever before, because once technology enables us to engineer \\nbodies, brains and minds, we can no longer be certain about anything – including things that previously \\nseemed fixed and ete rnal. \\nA thousand years ago, in 1018, there were many things people didn’t know about the future, but they were \\nnevertheless convinced that the basic features of human society were not going to change. If you lived in \\nChina in 1018, you knew that by 1050 th e Song Empire might collapse, the Khitans might invade from the \\nnorth, and plagues might kill millions. However, it was clear to you that even in 1050 most people would \\nstill work as farmers and weavers, rulers would still rely on humans to staff their arm ies and bureaucracies, \\nmen would still dominate women, life expectancy would still be about 40, and the human body would be \\nexactly the same. Hence in 1018, poor Chinese parents taught their children how to plant rice or weave silk, \\nand wealthier parents t aught their boys how to read the Confucian classics, write calligraphy or fight on \\nhorseback – and taught their girls to be modest and obedient housewives. It was obvious these skills would \\nstill be needed in 1050.  \\nIn contrast, today we have no idea how Ch ina or the rest of the world will look in 2050. We don’t know \\nwhat people will do for a living, we don’t know how armies or bureaucracies will function, and we don’t \\nknow what gender relations will be like. Some people will probably live much longer than t oday, and the \\nhuman body itself might undergo an unprecedented revolution thanks to bioengineering and direct brain -\\ncomputer interfaces. Much of what kids learn today will likely be irrelevant by 2050.  \\nAt present, too many schools focus on cramming informa tion. In the past this made sense, because \\ninformation was scarce, and even the slow trickle of existing information was repeatedly blocked by \\ncensorship. If you lived, say, in a small provincial town in Mexico in 1800, it was difficult for you to know \\nmuch about the wider world. There was no radio, television, daily newspapers or public libraries. Even if \\nyou were literate and had access to a private library, there was not much to read other than novels and \\nreligious tracts. The Spanish Empire heavily cens ored all texts printed locally, and allowed only a dribble ')"
